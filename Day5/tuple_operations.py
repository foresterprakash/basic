# Tuple operations
# use + sign to concatenate tuples

a = 1,2,3
b = 4,5,6

# print(a+b) # this concatenates these two tuples
# print(a*3) # this iterate the tuple

## there are only two methods in tuple data type.

#count() and index()

# lets use it 

a = (1,2,3,1,2,2,3,3,4,1,4)
c = a.count(1)
i = a.index(2)

print(c,i)
